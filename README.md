# CwFTT

## This is a scratch project!!!

## in this project
- topos theory
- categorical equivalence between zfset and type

## TODOS: (in order of proof dependency)


- [x] prove that topoi have partial map classifiers
- [x] prove that the over-categories of a topos are topoi
- [x] prove that topoi are locally cartesian closed
- prove that topoi have (epi-mono factorization)/imagemaps/...
- prove that there is an operation `𝒞.or : 𝒞.Ω ⊗ 𝒞.Ω⟶ 𝒞.Ω` which is lawful
- prove that the morphisms `X ⟶ 𝒞.Ω` have a heyting-algebra structure
- prove that the map `𝒞.Ω ⟶ 𝒞.Ω` induces a monotone closure-operation on all types `X ⟶ 𝒞.Ω`.

- *Refactor* the construction turning lawvere-tierney topologies into grothendieck topologies to use closure-operations
- prove that the internal notion of sheaves (w/r/t a LTT) corresponds to the external notion in the category of presheaves.
